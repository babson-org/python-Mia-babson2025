'''
please prepare two questions you may have on the tictactoe lab  --> labs/lab2/Lab 02.pdf 
and or run tictactoe.py in labs/lab2/student_code to see how the game plays -> but come 
up with two questions/

for instance, take a look at play_game.py.  One person could ask why is this line in the code:
sys.stdout.flush()  we haven't seen that before but what do you think it does?

Also, please prepare three questions you have on Python Notes Part 1 or Part 2 (pdfs)
-> week03/

TicTac Toe Lab
1. How does the program know to use our student file once the q is removed?
2. Will all the missing code required be stuff we have seen before
or something we will have to figure out?

Python Notes Questions
1. If the pass statement does nothing when would it ever be utilized?
2. What is the purpose of the finally block?
3. What does "args" mean?
